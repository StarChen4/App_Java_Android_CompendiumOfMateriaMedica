- Meeting Minutes - Week 3
  Date: Saturday, May 4, 2024
  Attendees: Xing, Hongjun, Yusi, Tianhao, Haochen
1. Project Timeline Review
   - The app is nearly complete with the majority of its functionalities implemented. The 'postshare' interface and some settings pages remain to be developed.


2. Detail Application Features
   - We reviewed our current features to assess how many meet the requirements and discussed potential additional features that could be developed.
   

3. Online Coding Session
   - Debugging the 'capture' fragment: There was an issue where the 'capture' fragment caused a crash in one team member's program after a pull. The team conducted a screen-sharing debugging session and resolved the problem.
   - Adjusting the login page prompt text: Changed the text from 'username' to 'email'.


4. Surprise Task: Code Optimization
    - Plans are underway to focus mainly on optimizing data access and storage to enhance app performance
    - Optimization for data storage: Tree structure for reading and writing data (load and initialize upon login, save upon closure)

5. Data Stream
    - There was some uncertainty about the specifics of the data stream implementation. After discussions and reviewing posts on the ED platform, we clarified the exact approach to take.

6. App Pages and Functions
    - Due to initial ambitious planning and time constraints, we decided to scale back on some of the envisioned pages and functions.

7. Report Content
    - Discussed whether the design patterns we're using meet the requirements and how to draft the report.
